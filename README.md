# degit-npm

degit is great, but I don't want to wait for the prompt and rename/exec actions to be implemented before making additional changes after cloning. This uses degit to make the clone and then replaces 'package-name' with the target name.

Currently only supports single-level target paths.
Currently outputs setup information for vite.

Its a crude implementation as its quickly created for a specific use case in react courses.
